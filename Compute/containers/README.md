## Overview

The Radius.Compute/containers Resource Type is the primary resource type for running one or more containers. It is always part of an Radius Application. It is analogous to a Kubernetes Deployment. The schema in the Resource Type definitition is heavily biased towards Kubernetes Pods and Deployments but is designed with the intension of supporting Recipes for AWS ECS, Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Instances, and Google Cloud Run in the fullness of time. 

Developer documentation is embedded in the Resource Type definition YAML file. Developer documentation is accessible via rad resource-type show Radius.Compute/containers.
