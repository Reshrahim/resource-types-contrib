      The Radius.Compute/containers Resource Type is the primary resource type for running one or more containers. It is always part of an Radius Application. It is analogous to a Kubernetes Deployment. To deploy a Container add a resource to the application definition Bicep file.

        resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
          name: 'myContainer'
          properties: {
            environment: environment
            application: myApplication.id
            containers: {
              demo: {
                image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
              }
            }
          }
        }

      By default, Containers deploys to Kubernetes. In this case, a Kubernetes Deployment named myContainer is deployed which includes a Pod named myContainer. Your Radius environment may deploy to other container platforms such as Azure Container Instances. 

      To accept network connections, expose a port on the container.

        resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
          name: 'myContainer'
          properties: {
            environment: environment
            application: myApplication.id
            containers: {
              demo: {
                image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
                ports: {
                  web: {
                    containerPort: 3000
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      
      When a port is included, a Kubernetes Service named demo with the type ClusterIP is created.
      
      To create a emphemeral emptyDir shared between two containers add a Containers.properties.volumes.

        resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
          name: 'myContainer'
          properties: {
            environment: environment
            application: myApplication.id
            containers: {
              demo: {
                image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
                volumeMounts:
                  volumeName: empty
                  mountPath: '/var/empty' 
              }
            }
            volumes:
              empty
          }
        }
